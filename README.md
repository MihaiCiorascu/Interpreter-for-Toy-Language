# Toy Language Interpreter

This project is an interpreter for a Toy Programming Language, implemented in **Java** using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

## Features

- **Toy Language Support**:
  - Variable declarations, assignments, arithmetic and logical expressions, conditionals, loops and file operations.
  - Reference types, heap management and garbage collection.
  - Concurrent execution through thread management.

- **Type Checker**:
  - Validates program type correctness before execution.

- **Graphical User Interface**:
  - Built with **JavaFX**, featuring program selection, heap and stack visualization, symbol tables and runtime program management.

- **Functional Programming**:
  - Utilized Java Streams for cleaner, efficient and declarative data processing.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Java Collections**: Generic implementations for stacks, dictionaries and lists.
- **File Handling**: Operations for reading and writing files during execution.
- **Concurrency**: Managed through thread-based execution with a shared heap.
- **Garbage Collection**: Implementation of safe memory management.
- **Functional Programming**: Leveraged Java Streams for functional-style data manipulation.
- **JavaFX GUI**: Interactive interface for managing and visualizing program state.
